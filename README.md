# Fundamentals of Supervised Machine Learning: Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project provides a hands-on exploration of logistic regression, showcasing model building, hyperparameter tuning, and technical analysis. Through synthetic dataset creation and visualization, we delve into logistic regression's nuances, emphasizing model optimization and in-depth statistical evaluation.

## Highlights
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Demonstrates dataset creation with `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`, visualized in 3D to illustrate class divisions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Discusses optimization of logistic regression models focusing on regularization, penalty norms, solver choice, and convergence criteria.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilizes a confusion matrix, classification report and ROC-curve to validate model accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Technical Analysis**: Performs a rigorous statistical analysis with `statsmodels.api`, comparing full and reduced models to quantify model fit and predictor significance.

## Key Concepts
- Understanding and applying hyperparameter tuning to improve logistic regression model performance.
- Interpreting complex statistical measures (Log-Likelihood, AIC, BIC) for model comparison and selection.
- Evaluating and interpreting model coefficients, odds ratios, and marginal effects for insightful predictive analysis.

## Goal
To provide a comprehensive understanding of logistic regression, balancing model accuracy against complexity, and furnishing a toolkit for statistical interpretation and decision making in predictive modeling.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python: Primary programming language.
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computations.
